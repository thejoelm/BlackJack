# BlackJack

I made this personal blackjack process to improve my knowledge on Python, as well as to get more familiar with building code using Python logic. 

# How to Use

To use this project, run the file in an IDE, and the prompt and game should appear in the console. A prompt should appear, so simply type your response and the game should continue. After you may have busted, the game will automatically end and a prompt stating if you have won or lost will appear. In addition, after you have stayed, the dealer will automatically play, and the result of the game will be displayed as well. 

# Blackjack Rules

The aim of blackjack is to finish the game with a higher total than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21. Going over 21 is commonly known as ‘busting’ and means an automatic loss.
All number cards (2-10) score the value indicated on them. The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) score 10 points and Ace can either be treated as 1 or 11.*
The player is dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer receives two cards, one face-up and another face-down.
The player is given a chance to draw more cards. Player can either ‘hit’ or ‘stay’. If the player calls out ‘HIT’, they are given an extra card. They can then either call out ‘HIT’ again, or ‘STAY’ if they do not wish to draw any more cards. The player can ‘HIT’ as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to ‘bust’ (exceed a total of 21).
After the player has played and either stood or busted, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either ‘HIT’ or ‘STAY’. If the dealer’s hand exceeds 21, if the player did not bust, they win immediately

*Note: The Ace interchangeably as 1 or 11 capability has not been added yet, but can be expected to be added within a week.
